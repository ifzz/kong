Kong is a scalable and customizable API Management Layer built on top of Nginx.

> **Note**: getkong.org is still a work in progress, in the meanwhile, please follow instructions in this README instead.

* **[Installation](#installation)**
* **[Documentation](#documentation)**
* **[Usage](#usage)**
* **[Development](#development)**

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions on your platform.

## Documentation

A complete documentation on how to configure and use Kong can be found at: [getkong.org/docs](http://getkong.org/docs). **(coming soon)**

## Usage

Use Kong through the `kong` executable. If you installed Kong via luarocks (as previously instructed) then `kong` should be in your `$PATH`.
```
$ kong --help
```

To start Kong (make sure your Cassandra instance is running):

```
$ kong start
```

## Development

To develop for Kong, simply run `[sudo] make install` in a clone of this repo. Then run:

```
$ make dev
```

This will install development dependencies and create your environment configuration files (`kong_TESTS.yml` and `kong_DEVELOPMENT.yml`).

- Run the tests:

```
$ make test-all
```

- Run Kong with the development configuration:

```
$ kong start -c kong_DEVELOPMENT.yml
```

#### Makefile
